<p style="font-size: xx-large; font-weight: bold;">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>
Welcome to this comprehensive experiment conducted using Compose Multiplatform, where we dive deep into performance metrics like FPS, Memory Usage, and App Size. The repository houses a total of 15 apps and 2 libraries, with 5 apps designed for Android and 10 for iOS. The core objective of this experiment is to gradually integrate KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform) and CMP (Compose Multiplatform) into these apps and compare their performance across various parameters.
